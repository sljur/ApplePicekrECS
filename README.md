My ECS version of the game was not completed, although you can see the image of the basket floating in the background; I moved the mousemovement code to the basket because I thought it would make the game more fun- since actually picking up the basket to catch all the apples would be cool. However, I wasn't able to get all three baskets to appear since I haven't been able to fix my spacing of the three geenrating baskets. Also, I was unable to even complete the first level of the game, hence why there's no score label placed anywhere. I struggeled with this asignemnt, and my main goal was to get the apples to appear and fall. Getting the baskets to show up at all was a bonus I wasn't expecting.

The Original screen shot shows a snippet of me playing the game; just lost a basket while I tried to take the photo, but otherwise, the game works. Screen shot was only takne on easy mode. Still, the game functions the way it's supposed to.
